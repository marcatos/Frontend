Frontend.js is writed in [CoffeeScript](coffeescript.org, \"CoffeeScript official site\") to take advantage of the class notation implemented and the cleaner object structure; it only implements a semantic structure to bind code, variables and events to a specific section or page.\r\n\r\nUsing this framework you must follow some simple directives to maintain the initial purposes:\r\n\r\n*   use closures\r\n*   extend the Abstract Frontend.js object if you don't need something very different and you're confident with js implementation\r\n*   use properly the semantic inherited methods from Abstract class\r\n\r\nCheck the [documentation](https://github.com/marcatos/Frontend/wiki/Documentation \"Documentation\") to find more specific indications for the use and contribute the project [reporting issues](https://github.com/marcatos/Frontend/issues) and proposing new features to implements.","google":"UA-51785625-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
