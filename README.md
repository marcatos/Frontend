Frontend.js
========

Frontend.js is a minimalistic framework that helps who usually use jQuery library to develop site's frontend.

No more need to write thousands of line of procedural-style code, let's give a structure to our js. Frontend.js is writed in [CoffeeScript](coffeescript.org "CoffeeScript official site") to take advantage of the class notation implemented and the cleaner object structure; it only implements a semantic structure to bind code, variables and events to a specific section or page.

Using this framework you must follow some simple directives to maintain the initial purposes:

*   use closures
*   extend the Abstract Frontend.js object if you don't need something very different and you're confident with js implementation
*   use properly the semantic inherited methods from Abstract class

Check the [documentation](https://github.com/marcatos/Frontend/wiki/Documentation "Documentation") to find more specific indications for the use and contribute the project [reporting issues](https://github.com/marcatos/Frontend/issues) and proposing new features to implements.
